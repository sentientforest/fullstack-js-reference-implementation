## Fullstack JavaScript Sample Application

This project is organized as a monorepo for user interfaces that share
a general-purpose Node.js backend.

This is a sample, reference application that is designed to allow one to
implement similar or the same user interface requirements in different
frameworks.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository, and use npm to install dependencies.


### Node.js APIs

Currently, the backend server provides a basic, hard coded reference API
with data on the countries of the world.

It implements HTTP GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods for individual
countries.

There is also a GET request implemented which will return the full list.
